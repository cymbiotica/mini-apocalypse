// What about the monster?
// There are 3 game modes – Decide before start: UH-OH, OMG, or CRA-CRA!
// UH-OH activates monster's die when supply box gets into the FoS. This is standard
// play.
// Once activated, the player rolling doubles of monster die’s face-up number turns
// monster die down one. A double 6 turns the monster die down to 5, a double 5 turns
// it down to 4 and so on.
// When monster die is on 1, a roll of snake eyes (double 1s) by either player ends the
// game. The monster gets in FoS and eats you!
// BUT . . . either player can be a hero by tossing 1 of their standing meeps onto
// monster die!
// That meep is forever gone (but never forgotten). The next snake eyes ends the game
// unless another meep jumps on monster die.
// Sacrificing a meep doesn’t need a roll of 7 and can be done with a meep from inside
// or outside of the FoS but only when monster's die is on 1.
// The one who rolls the snake eyes calls out yes or no if they are sacrificing a meep; if
// they call out no, then the opponent says yes or no; if they say no, then the roller of
// the snake eyes has one last chance and calls out yes or no if they are sacrificing a
// meep.
// If that's a no, then the monster wins! And you both lose.
// OMG mode activates monster die as soon as the game starts. This is a faster game
// but it sucks to be human.
// CRA-CRA allows either player to activate and turn down monster die by using
// their rolled 7s in addition to normal turn down on matching doubles.
// Dial the difficulty - is the game too easy? Set the monster die on 5, 4, or lower!
